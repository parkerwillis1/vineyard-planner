## Recommended Approach

1. **Screenshots**: Take actual screenshots from the app with sample data
2. **Diagrams**: Create simple diagrams for conceptual images (trellis systems, layout calculations)
3. **Charts**: Generate example charts showing realistic data patterns
4. **Forms**: Capture forms with sample data filled in to show proper usage

## File Naming Convention

Save images to `/public/docs/images/` with the naming format:
- `{tool}-{page}-{description}.png`
- Example: `planner-vineyard-design-config-form.png`
- Example: `operations-irrigation-ndvi-zone-map.png`
- Example: `production-fermentation-curve-chart.png`
